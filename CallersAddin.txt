Callers Add-in [FINAL 2.24 - Sept 12, 2011]

 UPDATE 2.21: fixed fatal typo bug introduced in v2.2 ...

 UPDATE 2.22: fixed 'exclude addin designer' introduced in v1.9 ...

 UPDATE 2.23: fixed 'underscore' incorrect behavior introduced
 in v1.8 (Initialize matched Class_Initialize) - thanks heaps
 to Kenneth Ives (kenaso) for your feedback ...

 UPDATE 2.24: fixed yet another bug - discovered the VBE Find
 function searches up to but not including the specified last
 line. Now correctly handles API declares with line continuation ...

 DETAILS:
 I borrowed code from Kamilche, Ulli and Darryl Hasieber to
 create this quite simple VB add-in that adds something I've
 sometimes needed as projects get too large and complex ...
 It adds a couple of entries to VB's code pane context menu
 so that when you right-click within a procedure (or on a
 declare) and select 'Callers' you get a popup menu listing
 all other routines in the project that call this code member ...
 It displays which routines reference any particular code member
 in the project, and allows you to select one to go to it - and
 a second entry called 'Callee' to go back if you wish ...

 FEATURES:
 Callee's include all procedures, API declares, Enums and Types,
 module level constants and variables, Implemented classes and
 Raised Events. Also identifies parent Type or Enum when right-
 clicking on one of their members. Finds public Enums of classes
 without being qualified by class name. Also adds a 'Clear' menu
 item to the Immediate Window ...

 This will probably be the last update as it seems to work fairly
 well now. However, bug reports or suggestions for improvement may
 see some further updates ...

 Just compile the project to automatically add the add-in to VB
 and get two new menu items 'Callers' and 'Callee' on the code
 context menu ... If you have compiled a previous version compile
 again with no VB IDE's open by selecting 'Make' on the
 Caller.vbp's context menu ... 16 kb zip.
