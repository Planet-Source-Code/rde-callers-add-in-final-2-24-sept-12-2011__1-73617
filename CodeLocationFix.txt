If a module contains a Declare statement that is split on multiple lines, the CodeLocation property of all the CodeModule's Members don't return the correct value, because the Declare is counted as a single line. For example, if you have the following module: 

Declare Function WritePrivateProfileString Lib "kernel32" Alias _
    "WritePrivateProfileStringA" (ByVal AppName$, ByVal KeyName$, _
    ByVal KeyDefault$, ByVal FileName$) As Long
Public MyVar As Long

The CodeLocation property of the MyVar member returns the value 2, instead of 6. And all the other members that follow are affected in the same fashion. Therefore, if you use the CodeLocation return value as an argument to the CodeModule's Lines property to retrieve the text of the member, you'll get the wrong text.

I haven't proofed this fix at all...

i = 1
Do While i < CodeLocation
   If Right$(CodeModule.Lines(i, 1), 1) = "_" Then
      CodeLocation = CodeLocation + 1
   End If
   i = i + 1
Loop

Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" _
              (pDest As Any, pSrc As Any, ByVal lLenB As Long)
i = 1
Do While i < CodeLocation
   If RightI(CodeModule.Lines(i, 1), 1) = 95% Then
      CodeLocation = CodeLocation + 1
   End If
   i = i + 1
Loop

Function RightI(sStr As String, ByVal lRightPos As Long) As Integer
    CopyMemory RightI, ByVal StrPtr(sStr) + LenB(sStr) - lRightPos - lRightPos, 2&
End Property
